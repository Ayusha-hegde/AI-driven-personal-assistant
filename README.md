# AI-driven-personal-assistant
This is a Python-based AI Personal Assistant that interacts with you through voice commands. It can perform tasks such as searching Wikipedia, opening websites like YouTube and Google, telling the current time, and sending emails using voice input and text-to-speech output.

The assistant uses speech recognition to understand your commands and responds using an offline text-to-speech engine for a smooth and natural interaction experience.
